For this CVE we use fuzzing to discover a stack buffer overflow caused by an integer underflow in libexif v 0.6.20.

The full [write up](writeup.md)
# Use
Start a docker container (Assuming you have the `aflplusplus/aflplusplus:latest`)

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/fuzz" --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --platform linux/amd64 --name fuzzing aflplusplus/aflplusplus:latest
```

```bash
mv /fuzz
./build.sh
./fuzzing.sh BUILD
```
If you want to trim your corpus samples
```
./trim_c.sh
```
This will take a while, i would suggest to not run this every time. Instead run it once and keep a backup of the result

Then to initiate the fuzz
```
./fuzzing.sh FUZZ
```
